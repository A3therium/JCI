I am a passionate collector of dolls house miniatures. Like many collectors, I also enjoy making some of my own furniture and accessories. My miniature quilts are hand stitched using the English Paper Piecing technique. My baskets are woven with waxed linen thread over florists' wire and can take anything from a few hours to a few days to complete.
